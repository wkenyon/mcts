---------

This program originated as a University of Minnestoa CSci 5512W (with Prof.
Arindam Banerjee) group project during the Spring 2007 semester. The original
group members were:

Michael Levin -- platform, threats and windows AIs
Jeff Deitch -- mesh and sequences AIs
Gabe Emerson -- research and project writeup
Erik Shimshock -- supplemental learning system (not included)

Source
------

The code is formatted in Linux-kernel style with 8-space tab width and 80-column
maximum width. You don't need to follow this style though.

You should not be using any function declared outside of src/shared.h.

src/ai/ai.c             generic AI helper functions
src/ai/utility.c        board utility functions and AI

How to add an AI
----------------

New AIs should be added to the src/ai folder in their own C source file. You can
include the standard library, GLib, and shared.h ("../shared.h") headers.

You will need to add your new source file to ai.c, shared.h, and Makefile.am.
Since you have modified the Makefile input, it will have to be rebuilt so you
need to have Automake installed.

If you do not have Automake, add your code on top of ai.c.

If you add any useful functions you wish to share with other AIs, add them to
shared.h under the AI section.
